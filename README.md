# Spotify-Data-Evaluation
I was given a Spotify data extract, I carried out a data evaluation to see what insights I could discover

The dashboard is available on the Tableau Public service

There were a few unexpected results in the data:
The Blues genre has the song with the highest tempo
The longest song is by Kenfrick Lamar and is over 12 minutes long!

Unsurprisingly "Pop" is the the most popular genre.
