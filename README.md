# Spotify-Data-Evaluation
I was given a Spotify data extract, I carried out a data evaluation to see what insights I could discover

The dashboard is available on the Tableau Public service

There were a few unexpected results in the data:
The Blues genre has the song with the highest tempo

The longest song is by Kenfrick Lamar and is over 12 minutes long!

Unsurprisingly "Pop" is the the most popular genre.

I concatenated some fields to help with the analysis e.g. Track Name and Artist Name to make "Song & Artist", I did this as there are many songs with the same name (including cover versions). 

Doing this would allow different songs with the same name to be treated differently in the rankings.
